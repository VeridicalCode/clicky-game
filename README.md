# Instrumental Memory

## What Is This Thing?
This simple browser game is a memory test, prompting players to click as many images as possible without repeating a choice, despite similar images which shuffle after each click.

## Why is it Special?
The game uses a library called `react-hooks-global-state`, which permits React to track global variables using a simple, straightforward syntax meant to mimic as closely as possible the function of local, component-isolated state hooks. This allows for clean and consistent coding comprised entirely of functional components and helper scripts.
